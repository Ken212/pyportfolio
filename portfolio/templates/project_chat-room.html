          This real-time chat room application utilizes Python's socket and
          threading modules to manage multiple client connections
          simultaneously. The server handles client connections and broadcasts
          messages, while the client side features a graphical user interface
          built with tkinter. This project integrates network communication with
          a user-friendly interface, allowing users to send and receive messages
          in real-time.

          The most challenging aspect was implementing concurrent client
          handling using threads, ensuring seamless communication without server
          blocking. Designing the GUI with tkinter was particularly interesting,
          as it involved creating an intuitive and responsive interface. This
          project demonstrates valuable experience in network programming,
          multi-threading, and GUI development, showcasing the ability to build
          robust and interactive applications.
