          The Audio Reader application, developed using Python, integrates The
          Audio Reader application, developed using Python, integrates Tkinter
          for its graphical interface, PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction, and
          pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion. This application enables users
          to select a PDF file, extract its content, and convert it into spoken
          audio, providing an accessible method to "listen" to PDF documents.
        </p>

          Throughout the project, managing Tkinter widgets for user interaction
          and implementing threading were crucial. Threading ensured smooth
          execution of the text-to-speech functionality without blocking the
          GUI. The most challenging aspect involved synchronizing text
          extraction and speech synthesis across potentially large PDF
          documents, requiring meticulous handling of threads and user events.

          A notable achievement was the seamless interaction between GUI
          components and backend processes, which significantly enhanced user
          experience. The project provided valuable insights into GUI
          development, file handling, and multithreading in Python, contributing
          to enhanced proficiency in application design and usability.
